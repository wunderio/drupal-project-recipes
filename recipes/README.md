### Drupal recipes

This directory contains examples of drupal recipes, as defined by the [Distributions and recipes core initiative](https://www.drupal.org/project/distributions_recipes).

The initiative is ongoing and currently we are gathering here our experiments to evaluate whether we can use this new
feature of Drupal to establish a set of common recipes to be used in wunder projects.

Recipes are installed using a script that has been added to Lando (check `.lando.yml`).

Check the `README.md` file in each recipe subdirectory for more information about how they can be used and installed.
